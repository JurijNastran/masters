# Integration and analysis of scRNAseq data using genome-scale metabolic models

As part of this master's thesis, we include the jupyter notebook *Experiments_and_Results.ipynb* as well as the other materials that enable anyone to reproduce the results and the visualizations presented in the thesis. 

Note that this repository does not include the four datasets that are crutial for the successfull execution of the code in the notebook. 
These datasets must be downloaded into the folder *data/preprocessing_results* using the following addresses:
* [mRNA0.csv  (original  mRNA data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQiPBxWf1h-Klr8FDmVS2hH2RHf2obT1/view?usp=sharing)
* [mRNA.csv (processed mRNA data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1knxmHTYj_aKf9zd0glEWNRTVWcXV_3NX/view?usp=sharing)
* [gpr_results.csv (GPR-based reaction flux estimations)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FW1NmuSrVNkSB6YZKN3KlZGRpdGHD7Um/view?usp=sharing)
* [lin_prog_results.csv (LP-based reaction flux estimations)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c32nJL_h1wZEBw6W4rynuiZenIzqgVYQ/view?usp=sharing)

The environment can be created from the included *environment.yml* file.
